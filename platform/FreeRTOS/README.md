FreeRTOS integration boundary
Keep FreeRTOS, TTC, EPS, shell, and OBDH-specific headers in this directory. Each adapter should parse its input into a source-specific context, then call the dependency-free core with cmd_engine_execute(command_id, &context).

The core must not include files from this directory.
